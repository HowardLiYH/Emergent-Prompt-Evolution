# Emergent Prompt Evolution v2

Tool-based capability levels with non-uniform regimes and agent memory for LLM specialization through competitive selection.

## Overview

This project extends the Emergent Preference Specialization framework to practical, tool-based capability levels:

| Level | Tool | Capability |
|-------|------|------------|
| L0 | Base LLM | Text completion only |
| L1 | Python | Code execution |
| L2 | Vision | Image analysis |
| L3 | RAG | Document retrieval |
| L4 | Web | Real-time data access |

## Key Features

- **Tool-based levels (L0-L4)**: Cumulative tool access with Thompson Sampling discovery
- **Non-uniform regimes**: Varying frequencies, rewards, and difficulties
- **Agent memory**: Hierarchical system with anti-leakage guarantees
- **Theorem 4**: Equilibrium distribution n_r ∝ (f_r × R_r × D_r)^(2/3)
- **ESB benchmark**: L0 baselines prove tool necessity
- **Cost efficiency**: 55% token savings over bandit baselines

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API key
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### Run Experiment

```bash
cd v2/experiments/main
python run_experiment.py --seed 0 --n-generations 100
```

### Run Full Pipeline

```bash
# All 10 seeds
for i in {0..9}; do
    python run_experiment.py --seed $i &
done
wait

# Baselines comparison
python -m experiments.baselines

# Ablation studies
python experiments/ablations/run_ablations.py

# ESB benchmark
python -m src.benchmark.runner --full
```

## Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Regime Coverage (CSE) | 20% (vs 0% Independent) |
| Failure Rate (CSE) | 42% (vs 50% Independent) |
| Break-even Point | 10 queries (95% CI: [8, 13]) |
| Training Cost (Subset K=3) | 1,956 tokens |
| Parallel Training Speedup | 2.32x (8 workers) |

## Commercial Value

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

CSE achieves **lower deployment costs** despite higher training investment:

```
Training Phase:
  CSE (Subset K=3): $0.002
  Independent:      $0.0007

Deployment Phase (per query):
  CSE:         $0.000163 (42% failure × 1.5x retry)
  Independent: $0.000175 (50% failure × 1.5x retry)

Break-even: ~10 queries
After 1M queries: CSE saves ~$12
```

### Why CSE for Production?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reliability** | 8% lower failure rate than Independent |
| **Capability** | Handles specialized tasks Independent cannot |
| **Scalability** | Sublinear training cost with subset competition |
| **Auditability** | Specialists are inspectable and explainable |
| **Parallelizable** | 2-3x wall-clock speedup during training |

### Deployment Options

1. **Full CSE**: Keep competition active for continuous improvement
2. **Cached Specialists**: O(1) lookup after training (recommended)
3. **Distilled Router**: Lightweight deployment without agent overhead

See `results/TCO_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md` for detailed analysis.

## Theoretical Contributions

### Theorem 4: Non-Uniform Equilibrium

Under non-uniform regime distribution:

```
n_r ∝ (f_r × R_r × D_r)^(2/3)
```

Where:
- f_r = regime frequency
- R_r = reward multiplier
- D_r = task difficulty

### Key Insights

1. **Tool Discovery**: Agents discover optimal regime-tool mappings through competition
2. **Fitness Sharing**: 1/√n penalty promotes niche diversification
3. **Memory Validity**: Strategies, not answers, are stored (anti-leakage)
4. **Emergence Verified**: 8 unique patterns across 10 seeds
