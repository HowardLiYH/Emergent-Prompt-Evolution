## [v4.0.3] - 2026-01-05: Practical Benefit Data Correction (n=3)

### Data Verification & Correction

**Issue Found**: Practical benefit numbers needed proper statistical reporting with n≥3.

**Valid Runs (after content filtering fix)**:
- Run 2: 20.8% → 79.2% = +58.3pp
- Run 3: 25.0% → 70.8% = +45.8pp
- Run 4: 25.0% → 62.5% = +37.5pp (NEW)

**Final Statistics (n=3)**:
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Single Generalist | 23.6% |
| Oracle Routing | 70.8% |
| Mean Improvement | **+47.2pp** |
| Std Dev | ±10.5pp |
| Range | +37.5pp to +58.3pp |

**Files Updated**:
- `paper/main.tex` - All practical benefit claims
- `paper/deep_dive.tex` - All practical benefit claims
- `docs/DEEP_DIVE.md` - All practical benefit claims
- `README.md` - Key results table

**Note**: Run 1 (+20.8pp) was discarded as it was before content filtering fix (v4.0.1).

## [v4.0.2] - 2026-01-04: Phase 2 Polish (Panel Consensus)

### Paper Improvements (4 Essential Tasks)

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Theorem 3 Tightening** | Explicit Azuma-Hoeffding bounds, 4-step proof structure | ✅ Complete |
| **Fitness Sensitivity Integration** | Added table label, enhanced caption in paper | ✅ Complete |
| **N=48 Carrying Capacity** | New Appendix section with formal scaling analysis | ✅ Complete |
| **Deployment Limitations** | Expanded section with routing, cost, latency tradeoffs | ✅ Complete |

### Key Additions to Paper

**Theorem 3 Proof (Tightened)**:
- Step 1: Submartingale property definition
- Step 2: Explicit Azuma-Hoeffding inequality application
- Step 3: Concentration bound derivation with explicit constants
- Step 4: Large deviation bound via Freidlin-Wentzell theory

**Carrying Capacity Formalization**:
- $N^* = R \cdot k$ where $k \approx 3$ is optimal
- $\mathbb{E}[\text{gens to L3}] \sim O(N/R)$
- Practitioner guidance: use $N \leq 3R$ for fast convergence

**Deployment Limitations**:
- Routing overhead analysis
- Training cost breakdown (9,600 API calls, 5-7 task break-even)
- Model-specific tuning considerations
- Latency tradeoffs (ensemble vs confidence routing)

### Panel Decision

Per the distinguished panel's consensus: "Do less, not more."

| Category | Tasks | Outcome |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **DO** | 4 essential | ✅ All completed |
| **OPTIONAL** | 2 (latency, related work) | Deferred |
| **CANCELLED** | 4 (n=100, learned routing, philosophy, error patterns) | Skipped to avoid dilution |

## [v4.0.1] - 2026-01-04: Content Filtering Fix

### Critical Fix: Gemini Content Filtering

**Problem**: Gemini was returning empty responses due to:
1. Safety filters blocking "research" content
2. Defensive behavior triggered by `[System Instructions: ...]` pattern (looks like jailbreak)

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Safety Settings** - Added `BLOCK_NONE` for all harm categories:
```python
"safetySettings": [
    {"category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT", "threshold": "BLOCK_NONE"},
    {"category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH", "threshold": "BLOCK_NONE"},
    {"category": "HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT", "threshold": "BLOCK_NONE"},
    {"category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT", "threshold": "BLOCK_NONE"},
]
```

2. **Native System Instruction API** - Changed from embedding in prompt to using proper API field:
```python
# Before (triggered defensive responses):
full_prompt = f"[System Instructions: {system}]\n\n{prompt}"

# After (proper API usage):
payload["systemInstruction"] = {"parts": [{"text": system}]}
```

### Results Improvement

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Oracle Routing Accuracy | 54.2% | **79.2%** |
| Improvement vs Baseline | +20.8pp | **+58.3pp** |

## [v3.10.0] - 2026-01-04: Unified Model (gemini-2.5-flash)

### Model Unification
- **All experiments now use gemini-2.5-flash** for consistency
- Previous experiments used mixed models (gemini-2.0-flash, gpt-4o-mini)
- Re-running all 10 seeds with unified model for scientific rigor

### LLM Client Fix
- Fixed "Empty parts in response" error handling
- Now gracefully handles content filtering (returns empty string instead of raising)
- More robust for gemini-2.5-flash which has stricter safety filters

### Benefits of gemini-2.5-flash
- **Higher rate limits**: 1000 RPM (vs 10-15 RPM for older models)
- **Better quality**: Improved reasoning over gemini-2.0-flash
- **Cost effective**: Free tier available
- **Unified results**: All seeds now comparable

### Experiment Results (COMPLETE)

**Unified 10-Seed Validation:**

| Seed | Pass Rate |
|------|-----------|
| 1-10 | 64.3% - 75.0% |
| **Mean** | **70.7%** |
| **95% CI** | **[68.3%, 73.1%]** |
| **CI Width** | 4.8% (84% narrower than mixed-model) |
