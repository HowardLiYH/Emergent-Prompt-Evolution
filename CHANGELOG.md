# Changelog

All notable changes to the Emergent Prompt Evolution project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md to track project progress
- Context Engineering v7 plan with Stanford Professor recommendations

### Changed
- Research framing updated to focus on "competitive selection" rather than "emergence"
- Experiment configuration updated to 10 seeds for statistical power

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- 10 orthogonal domains based on cognitive science frameworks
  - Arithmetic, Algorithmic, Factual, Procedural, Creative
  - Summarization, Causal, Analogical, Coding, Scientific
- Strategy library architecture (280 strategies planned)
- Example library architecture (150 examples planned)
- Validation pre-test with explicit success criteria
- Random strategy baseline for ablation studies
- Fitness sharing diversity mechanism
- Compute cost tracking

### Changed
- Task types redesigned for maximum distinctiveness
- Evolution mechanism changed from replacement to cumulative
- Agent prompt budget increased from 200 to 800 words

---

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-XX

### Added
- Initial GenesisAgent implementation
- Task pool with Math, Coding, Logic, Language types
- Competition engine with winner-take-all dynamics
- Basic prompt evolution (directed, random, minimal)
- LLM client with rate limiting and retries
- Specialization metrics (LSI, semantic, behavioral)
- Prompt swap counterfactual test

### Issues Identified
- Low LSI (0.15-0.18) indicating weak specialization
- Convergence to single specialty ("logic")
- Shallow prompts lacking context
- No cumulative learning mechanism

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-XX

### Added
- Project structure and README
- Basic agent and task data classes
- Initial experiment scripts
